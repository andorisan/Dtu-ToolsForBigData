&quot;in march 1871 the commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. then [[adolphe thiers|versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[robespierre]]'s '[[reign of terror|terror]]' of 1793–1794. more than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like new caledonia. thousands of others fled to belgium, england, italy, spain and the united states. in 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned communards. meanwhile, the third republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[napoleon iii of france|louis napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion – in indochina, africa, and oceania. many of france's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the commune ([[gustave courbet|courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[arthur rimbaud|rimbaud]] and [[pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. the ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the third republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot;

categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.the first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. [[simon baron-cohen]]'s [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. an extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.&lt;ref name=e-s-theory/&gt;  these theories are somewhat related to baron-cohen's earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the [[sally–anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name=&quot;e-s-theory&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = baron-cohen s | title = autism: the empathizing–systemizing (e-s) theory | journal = annals of the new york academy of sciences | volume = 1156 | pages = 68–80 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19338503 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x | url = http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_bc_nyas.pdf | format = pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131214134422/http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_bc_nyas.pdf | archivedate = 14 december 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;nat. geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;changing greenland – melt zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by mark jenkins in ''[[national geographic (magazine)|national geographic]]'' june 2010, accessed 8 july 2010&lt;/ref&gt;hence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.===small-scale effects===albedo works on a smaller scale, too. in sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=health and safety: be cool!

[[deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt;studies by the [[hadley centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;betts&quot; /&gt;===water===water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[fresnel equations]] (see graph).[[file:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°c (refractive index=1.333)]]at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. at small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;fresnel&quot; /&gt;although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). however, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. fresh 'black' ice exhibits fresnel reflection.===clouds===[[cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;on any given day, about half of earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=baffled scientists say less sunlight reaching earth |publisher=livescience |date=24 january 2006 |accessdate=19 august 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=nature |accessdate=7 july 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archivedate=3 may 2006|page=601|volume=418|format=pdf|date=8 august 2002|deadurl=yes|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002natur.418..601t|pmid=12167846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[phoenician alphabet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted entirely of [[consonant]]s (for that reason, it is also called an [[abjad]] to distinguish it from a true [[alphabet]]). in turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-sinaitic script]]&lt;ref name=coll&gt;{{harvnb|hall-quest|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.in 1600 b.c.e., the phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the [[hebrew alphabet|hebrew]] or [[arabic script|arabic]] aleph.{|

a.svg|64 px|modern script a]]&lt;br /&gt;modern script a|}when the [[ancient greece|ancient greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [[glottal stop]]—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[phoenician language|phoenician]] and other [[semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{ipa|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. in the earliest greek inscriptions after the [[greek dark ages]], dating to the 8th century bc, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.the [[etruscan civilization|etruscans]] brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[italian peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. the romans later adopted the [[old italic script|etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[latin|latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[latin script|latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including english.===typographic variants===[[file:a-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter a.]]during roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter &quot;a&quot;. first was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other &quot;permanent&quot; mediums. there was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. due to the &quot;perishable&quot; nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. the known variants include the early [[uncial script#half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{harvnb|diringer|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[file:lowercasea.svg|left|thumb|200px|typographic variants include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''.]]at the end of the [[roman empire]] (5th century ad), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe. among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[italy]], the [[merovingian script]] in france, the [[visigothic script]] in spain, and the [[insular script|insular]] or anglo-irish semi-uncial or anglo-saxon majuscule of great britain. by the 9th century, the [[carolingian minuscule|caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. this form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=americana/&gt;15th-century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. these variants, the ''italic'' and ''roman'' forms, were derived from the caroline script version. the italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. this slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval irish and english writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; the roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (&quot;a&quot;).&lt;ref name=americana/&gt; both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. in greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. many fonts then made the right leg vertical. in some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.[[italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in roman type). there are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' (&quot;ɑ&quot;), also called [[latin alpha]], is used in contrast with latin &quot;a&quot; (such as in the [[international phonetic alphabet]]).==use in writing

areas. in addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham.one result was that [[jefferson county,

redistrict. united states supreme court cases of ''[[baker v. carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[reynolds v. sims]]'' (1964) ruled that the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot; needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as alabama had used for its senate.in 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. this benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt; other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.african americans continued to

legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties. there is very limited home rule, but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies. this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues. alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. in the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[dillard v. crenshaw county]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. at-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.as part of settlement of this case, five alabama cites and counties, including [[chilton county, alabama|chilton county]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. in another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[conecuh county, alabama|conecuh county]]. in 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[conecuh county, alabama|conecuh county]]. together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;cum&quot;&gt;[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 &quot;cumulative

critics argue that alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. most counties do not have home rule. any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.[[file:ala supreme court building feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|the [[alabama judicial building]] in montgomery. it houses the [[alabama supreme court]], [[alabama court of civil appeals]], and [[alabama court of criminal appeals]].]]alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. the [[legislative branch]] is the [[alabama legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[alabama house of representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[alabama senate]], with 35 members. the legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. the [[republican party (united states)|republican party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[alabama legislature|legislature]]. the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. in ''[[reynolds v. sims]]'' (1964), the us supreme court implemented the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.at that time, alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. for instance, birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but jefferson county received only 1/67th of state services in funding. through the legislative delegations, the alabama legislature kept control of county governments.[[file:portrait-governor-kay-ivey.jpg|thumb|governor [[kay ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of alabama]]. she is the only republican female governor in the state's history.]]the [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. it is headed by the [[governor of alabama]]. other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[attorney general of alabama]], the [[alabama secretary of state]], the [[alabama state treasurer]], and the [[state auditor of alabama]]. the current [[governor of alabama|governor]] of the state is [[republican party (united states)|republican]] [[kay ivey]]. the office of [[list of lieutenant governors of alabama|lieutenant governor]] is currently vacant.the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections. statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following january.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |title=alabama's legislative process |first=mcdowell |last=lee |year=2009 |publisher=state of alabama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162559/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |archivedate=january 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;the [[judiciary|judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[alabama constitution|constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. the [[state supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[supreme court of alabama]]. alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajs&quot;&gt;[http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=al judicial selection in the states: alabama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162358/http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=al |date=october 6, 2014 }}, american judicature society.&lt;/ref&gt;

presidential election.]]alabama has 67 [[county (united states)|counties]]. each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. it also has limited executive authority in the county. because of the constraints of the [[alabama constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (jefferson, lee, mobile, madison, montgomery, shelby, and tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. instead, most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. the cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems, and the state legislators being buried in local county issues.the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;/&gt; legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. united states supreme court decisions in ''[[baker v. carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. the rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.&quot;the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.cmemrnbk.dpuf albert p. brewer,

the political coalition of white democrats known as the [[redeemers]] took control of the state government from the republicans, in part by suppressing the african-american vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.after 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise african american residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites. by 1941 more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. the total effects were greater on the african-american community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.from 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. as counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. governor [[george wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. only after passage of the federal [[civil rights act of 1964]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and [[voting rights act of 1965]] did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. in many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.in 2007, the [[alabama legislature]] passed, and republican governor [[bob riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. in a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[alabama state capitol]], which housed congress of the [[confederate states of america]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=phillip |last=rawls |title=alabama offers

justice of alabama, [[ernest c. hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to republican [[perry o. hooper, sr.]]. hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four

has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution.== etymology ==[[linear b]] tablets attest to the personal name ''achilleus'' in the forms ''a-ki-re-u'' and ''a-ki-re-we'',&lt;ref name=&quot;new pauly&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author1=dorothea sigel|author2=anne ley|author3=bruno bleckmann|entry=achilles|encyclopedia=brill’s new pauly|editor=hubert cancik et al.|publisher=brill reference online|doi=10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e102220}} accessed 5 may 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''iliad'' (and frequently by achilles himself). achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of {{lang|grc|κλέος}} ''{{transl|grc|kléos}}'' (&quot;glory&quot;, usually in war). furthermore, ''laós'' has been construed by [[gregory nagy]], following [[leonard palmer]], to mean &quot;a corps of soldiers&quot;, a [[muster (military)|muster]].&lt;ref name=nagy/&gt; with this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.another etymology relates the name to a [[proto-indo-european]] [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''*h₂eḱ-pṓds'' &quot;sharp foot&quot; which first gave an [[illyrian languages|illyrian]] ''*āk̂pediós'', evolving through time into ''*ākhpdeós'' and then ''*akhiddeús''. the shift from ''-dd-'' to ''-ll-'' is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via a [[pre-greek]] source. the first root part ''*h₂eḱ-'' &quot;sharp, pointed&quot; also gave greek ἀκή (''akḗ'' &quot;point, silence, healing&quot;), ἀκμή (''akmḗ'' &quot;point, edge, zenith&quot;) and ὀξύς (''oxús'' &quot;sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever&quot;), whereas ἄχος stems from the root ''*h₂egʰ-'' &quot;to be upset, afraid&quot;. the whole expression would be comparable to the [[latin]] ''acupedius'' &quot;swift of foot&quot;. compare also the latin word family of ''aciēs'' &quot;sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement&quot;, ''acus'' &quot;needle, pin, bodkin&quot;, and ''acuō'' &quot;to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse&quot; (whence ''acute'').&lt;ref&gt;cf. the wiktionary entries [[wikt:Ἀχιλλεύς|&quot;Ἀχιλλεύς&quot;]] and [[wikt:reconstruction:proto-indo-european/h₂eḱ-|''*h₂eḱ-'']].&lt;/ref&gt; some [[literary topos|topical]] [[epitheta]] of achilles in the ''iliad'' point to this &quot;swift-footedness&quot;, namely ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεὺς (''podárkēs dĩos achilleús'' &quot;swift-footed divine achilles&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;''iliad'' 1.121, 2.688.&lt;/ref&gt;

''iliad'' 1.58, 1.84, 1.148, 1.215, 1.364, 1.489.&lt;/ref&gt;some researchers deem the name a [[loan word]], possibly from a [[pre-greek]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;new pauly&quot;/&gt; achilles' descent from the [[nereid]] [[thetis]] and a similarity of his name with those of [[potamoi|river deities]] such as [[acheron]] and [[achelous]] have led to speculations about him being an old [[greek sea gods|water divinity]] (see below [[achilles#worship|worship]]).&lt;ref&gt;cf. the supportive position of {{cite journal|author=hildebrecht hommel|title=der gott achilleus|journal=sitzungsberichte der heidelberger akademie der wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38–44}}&amp;nbsp;– a critical point of view is taken by {{cite journal|author=j. t. hooker|title=the cults of achilleus|journal=rheinisches museum für philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[robert s. p. beekes]] has suggested a [[pre-greek]] origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of ''-λλ-'' and ''-λ-'' in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /l&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;/ in the original language.&lt;ref name=beekes&gt;robert s. p. beekes, ''etymological dictionary of greek'', brill, 2009, pp. 183ff.&lt;/ref&gt;== birth and early years ==[[file:achilleus lyra.jpg|thumb|[[chiron]] teaching achilles how to play the [[lyre]], roman [[fresco]] from [[herculaneum]], 1st century ad]]achilles was the son of the [[nereid]] [[thetis]] and of [[peleus]], the king of the [[myrmidons]].

in the later vase paintings presenting achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body. peleus entrusted achilles to [[chiron]] the [[centaur]], on [[mount pelion]], to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[hesiod]], ''catalogue of women'', fr. 204.87–89 mw; ''iliad'' 11.830–832.&lt;/ref&gt; thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity.  achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the trojan war.&lt;ref&gt;''iliad'' 9.410ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

(the red-haired girl). with lycomedes' daughter [[deidamia (mythology)|deidamia]], whom in the account of statius he rapes, achilles there fathers a son, [[neoptolemus]] (also called pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). according to this story, odysseus learns from the prophet [[calchas]] that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles' aid. odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. when achilles instantly takes up the spear, odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign. in another version of the story, odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.== achilles in the trojan war ==according to the ''iliad'', achilles arrived at troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[myrmidons]].&lt;ref&gt;''iliad'' 2.681–685.&lt;/ref&gt;

ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to achilles, were discovered by captain kritzikly in 1823 on snake island. a second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. a fifth century bc [[black-glazed ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: &quot;glaukos, son of poseidon, dedicated me to achilles, lord of leuke.&quot; in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc, a statue is dedicated to achilles, lord of leuke, by a citizen of olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.&lt;ref name=hedreen/&gt;the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on ''leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''[[aethiopis]]'' according to which, after his untimely death, thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical Λεύκη Νῆσος (''leúkē nêsos'' &quot;white island&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[proclus]], ''chrestomathia'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; already in the fifth century bc, [[pindar]] had mentioned a cult of achilles on a &quot;bright island&quot; (φαεννά νᾶσος, ''phaenná nâsos'') of the black sea,&lt;ref&gt;pindar, ''nemea'' 4.49ff.; arrian, ''[[periplus of the euxine sea]]'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while in another of his works, pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[island of the blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[peleus]] and [[cadmus]].&lt;ref&gt;pindar, ''olympia'' 2.78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; well known is the connection of these mythological [[fortunate isles]] (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, ''makárôn nêsoi'') or the homeric [[elysium]] with the stream [[oceanus]] which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it.&lt;ref name=hedreen/&gt; guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[alcaeus of mytilene|alcaeus]], speaking of &quot;achilles lord of scythia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;d. page, ''lyrica graeca selecta'', oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposition of north and south, as evoked by achilles' fight against the [[aethiopia]]n prince [[memnon (mythology)|memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[eos]] after his death.the ''[[periplus ponti euxini|periplus of the euxine sea]]'' (c. 130 ad) gives the following details:{{quote|it is said that the goddess thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son achilles, who dwells there. here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. this island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to achilles. in this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to achilles in gratitude. one can still read inscriptions in greek and latin, in which achilles is praised and celebrated. some of these are worded in patroclus’ honour, because those who wish to be favored by achilles, honour patroclus at the same time. there are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after achilles’ temple. every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. and after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. they bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in achilles’ honour. but there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. as they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult achilles' oracle. they ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. but in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. and then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. so, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. to some of the people who come to this island, achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.&lt;ref name=densuşianu/&gt;}}the greek geographer [[dionysius periegetes]], who lived probably during the first century ad, wrote that the island was called ''leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. it is said that there, in leuce island, reside the souls of achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;dionysius periegetes, ''orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in densuşianu 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.&lt;ref&gt;arrian, ''[[periplus of the euxine sea]]'' 21; scholion to pindar, ''nemea'' 4.79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hedreen/&gt;

leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. pausanias reports that the [[delphi]]c [[pythia]] sent a lord of [[crotone|croton]] to be cured of a chest wound.&lt;ref&gt;pausanias, ''description of greece'' 3.19.13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ammianus marcellinus]] attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.&lt;ref&gt;ammianus marcellinus, ''res gestae'' 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles. [[herodotus]], [[pliny the elder]] and [[strabo]] reported on the existence of a town ''achílleion'' (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from [[mytilene]] in the sixth century bc, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the [[troad]].&lt;ref name=troad/&gt; later attestations point to an ''achílleion'' in [[messenia]] (according to [[stephanus byzantinus]]) and an ''achílleios'' (Ἀχίλλειος) in [[laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;pausanias, ''description of greece'' 3.25.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[nicolae densuşianu]] recognized a connection to achilles in the names of [[aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the danube delta, called [[chilia veche|chilia]] (presumably from an older ''achileii''), though his conclusion, that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&lt;ref name=densuşianu&gt;nicolae densuşianu: ''dacia preistorică''. bucharest: carol göbl, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;the kings of [[epirus (ancient state)|epirus]] claimed to be descended from achilles through his son, [[neoptolemus]]. [[alexander the great]], son of the epirote princess [[olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at [[achilleion (troad)#tomb of achilles|achilleion]] while passing troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[arrian]], ''[[anabasis alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[cicero]], ''pro archia poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; in ad 216 the roman emperor [[caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[parthia]], emulated alexander by holding games around achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[dio cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;== reception during antiquity ===== achilles in greek tragedy ==={{main article|achilleis (trilogy)}}the [[tragedy|greek tragedian]] [[aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles, given the title ''achilleis'' by modern scholars. the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war, including his defeat of [[hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[paris (mythology)|paris]] and guided by [[apollo]] punctures his heel. extant fragments of the ''achilleis'' and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. the first part of the ''achilleis'' trilogy, ''the myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus, who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;pantelis michelakis, ''achilles in greek tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; in plato's ''symposium'', phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved; phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.&lt;ref&gt;plato, ''symposium'', translated benjamin jowett, dover thrift editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;the tragedian [[sophocles]] also wrote ''the lovers of achilles'', a play with achilles as the main character. only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;s. radt. ''tragicorum graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (göttingen: vandenhoeck &amp; ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149–157a.&lt;/ref&gt;towards the end of the 5th century bc, a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama; euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[hecuba (play)|hecuba]]'', ''[[electra (euripides)|electra]]'', and ''[[iphigenia in aulis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;latacz 2010&quot;&gt;latacz 2010&lt;/ref&gt;=== achilles in greek philosophy ===the philosopher [[zeno of elea]] centered one of [[zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;[[epithets in homer#individuals|swift-footed]]&quot; [[zeno's paradoxes#achilles and the tortoise|achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school, zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.=== achilles in roman and medieval literature ===the romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to troy, took a highly negative view of achilles.&lt;ref name=&quot;latacz 2010&quot;/&gt;

other writers, such as [[catullus]], [[propertius]], and [[ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on achilles' erotic career. this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as [[dictys cretensis]] and [[dares phrygius]] and in [[benoît de sainte-maure]]'s ''[[roman de troie]]'' and [[guido delle colonne]]'s ''[[historia destructionis troiae]]'', which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the [[matter of troy]] until the 17th century.achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler [[leo the deacon]], not as [[hellenes|hellene]], but as [[scythians|scythian]], while according to the byzantine author [[john malalas]], his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as [[bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ekonomou|first1=andrew|title=byzantine rome and the greek popes|date=2007|publisher=lexington books|location=uk|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zomzk6dbftic&amp;pg=pa123&amp;dq=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cbwq6aewagovchmi6kfx5bh2xwivgawsch291wlv#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20malalas%20myrmidons%20achilles&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 september 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=jeffreys|first1=elizabeth|last2=croke|first2=brian|title=studies in john malalas|location=australian association for byzantine studies, department of modern greek, university of sydney,|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p55maaaamaaj&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&amp;dq=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cciq6aewawovchmi6kfx5bh2xwivgawsch291wlv|accessdate=14 september 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;==achilles in modern literature and arts ==&lt;!-- please add new works with the year of first publication in the correct subcategory. --&gt;[[file:wenceslas hollar - briseis and achilles.jpg|thumb|right|''briseis and achilles'', engraving by [[wenceslaus hollar]] (1607–1677)]][[file:peter paul rubens - the wrath of achilles - google art project.jpg|thumb|''the wrath of achilles'' (c. 1630–1635), painting by [[peter paul rubens]]]][[file:peter paul rubens 003.jpg|thumb|''the death of hector'', unfinished oil painting by [[peter paul rubens]]]][[file:the education of achilles, by james barry.jpg|thumb|''the education of achilles'' (c. 1772), by [[james barry (painter)|james barry]] ([[yale center for british art]])]][[file:leon benouville the wrath of achilles.jpg|thumb|''the wrath of achilles'', by [[françois-léon benouville]] (1847;

in doing so, he preserved the [[union (american civil war)|union]], paved the way to abolition of slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.born in [[hodgenville, kentucky]], lincoln grew up on the [[american frontier|western frontier]] in [[kentucky]] and [[indiana]]. largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in [[illinois]], a [[whig party (united states)|whig party leader]], and was elected to the [[illinois house of representatives]], in which he served for eight years. elected to the [[united states house of representatives]] in 1846, lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, tariffs, and railroads. because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in congress, and because his opposition to the [[mexican–american war]] was unpopular among illinois voters, lincoln returned to [[springfield, illinois|springfield]] and resumed his successful law practice. reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new [[history of the united states republican party|republican party]], which had a statewide majority in illinois. in 1858, while taking part in a [[lincoln–douglas debates|series of highly publicized debates]] with his opponent and rival, democrat [[stephen a. douglas]], lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the u.s. senate race to douglas. in 1860, lincoln secured the republican party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state, by being the second choice of a grand majority of convention delegates whose first choices, due to factionalism, could not garner enough votes to win. though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the south, he swept the north and was [[united states presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]].lincoln's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the [[confederate states of america]] before he moved into the [[white house]]—no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession. subsequently, on april 12, 1861, a confederate attack on [[fort sumter]] inspired the north to enthusiastically rally behind the [[union (american civil war)|union]]. as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party, lincoln confronted radical republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the south; [[war democrats]], who called for more compromise; anti-war democrats (called [[copperhead (politics)|copperheads]]), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. politically, lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political [[patronage]], and by appealing to the american people with his powers of oratory.&lt;ref&gt;randall (1947), pp. 65–87.&lt;/ref&gt; his [[gettysburg address]] became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war. his primary goal was to reunite the nation. he suspended [[habeas corpus]], leading to the controversial ''[[ex parte merryman]]'' decision, and he averted potential british intervention in the war by defusing the [[trent affair|''trent'' affair]] in late 1861. lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general, [[ulysses s. grant]]. he also made major decisions on union war strategy, including a [[union blockade|naval blockade]] that shut down the south's normal trade, moves to take control of kentucky and tennessee, and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system. lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the confederate capital at [[richmond, virginia|richmond]]; each time a general failed, lincoln substituted another, until finally grant succeeded. as the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the [[emancipation proclamation]] of 1863; lincoln used the u.s. army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the [[border states (american civil war)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushed through congress the [[thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery.an exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, lincoln reached out to the war democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the [[united states presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. anticipating the war's conclusion, lincoln pushed a moderate view of [[reconstruction era of the united states|reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. on april 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of confederate commanding general [[robert e. lee]], lincoln was assassinated by confederate sympathizer [[john wilkes booth]] and died the next day. lincoln has been consistently [[historical rankings of presidents of the united states#scholar survey results|ranked]] both by scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;ranking our presidents&quot;&gt;[http://history-world.org/pres.pdf &quot;ranking our presidents&quot;]. james lindgren. november 16, 2000. international world history project.&lt;/ref&gt;

in the early 1850s, lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for henry clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to &quot;both extremes&quot; on the slavery issue.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 182–185.&lt;/ref&gt; as the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the [[nebraska territory]] and [[kansas territory]] became particularly acrimonious, and senator [[stephen a. douglas]] of illinois proposed [[popular sovereignty in the united states#emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise measure; the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of congress by allowing the people of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves. the proposal alarmed many northerners, who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories. despite this northern opposition, douglas's [[kansas-nebraska act]] narrowly passed congress in may 1854.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 188–190.&lt;/ref&gt;for months after its passage, lincoln did not publicly comment on the kansas-nebraska act, but he came to strongly oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

speaking in his kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice,&lt;ref&gt;white, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; he said the kansas act had a &quot;''declared'' indifference, but as i must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. i cannot but hate it. i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;basler (1953), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; lincoln's attacks on the kansas-nebraska act marked his return to political life.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 203–205.&lt;/ref&gt;nationally, the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas–nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. reflecting the demise of his party, lincoln would write in 1855, &quot;i think i am a whig, but others say there are no whigs, and that i am an abolitionist [...] i do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt;  drawing on the antislavery portion of the whig party, and combining [[free soil party|free soil]], [[liberty party (united states, 1840)|liberty]], and antislavery [[democratic party (united states)|democratic party]] members, the new [[republican party (united states)|republican party]] formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery.&lt;ref&gt;mcgovern, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt; lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing whig party, though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[know nothing]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt;lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature as whig.  in the aftermath of the 1854 elections, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the kansas-nebraska act, lincoln declined to take his seat and instead sought election to the united states senate.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt; at that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;oates, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; after leading in the first six rounds of voting, but unable to obtain a majority, lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[lyman trumbull]]. trumbull was an antislavery democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery democrats, had vowed not to support any whig. lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull's antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate, [[joel aldrich matteson]].&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 205–208.&lt;/ref&gt;in part due to the ongoing [[bleeding kansas|violent political confrontations in the kansas]], opposition to the kansas-nebraska act remained strong in illinois and throughout the north. as the [[united states elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, lincoln abandoned the defunct whig party in favor of the republicans. he attended the may 1856 [[bloomington convention]], which formally established the [[illinois republican party]]. the convention platform asserted that congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of kansas as a free state. lincoln gave the [[lincoln's lost speech|final speech]] of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the union.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 216–221.&lt;/ref&gt; at the june [[1856 republican national convention]], lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of [[john c. frémont]] and [[william dayton]]. lincoln strongly supported the republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout illinois. the democrats nominated former ambassador [[james buchanan]], who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories, while the know nothings nominated former whig president [[millard fillmore]].&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 224–228.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1856 elections, buchanan defeated both his challengers, but frémont won several northern states and republican [[william henry bissell]] won election as governor of illinois. though lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading republican in illinois.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 229–230.&lt;/ref&gt;[[eric foner]] (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the united states|republicanism principles]] of the [[founding fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[united states declaration of independence|declaration of independence]].&lt;ref&gt;foner (2010), pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt;[[file:dredscott.jpg|alt=painting|thumb|upright|a portrait of [[dred scott]]. lincoln denounced the supreme court decision in ''dred scott v. sandford'' as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery.]]in march 1857, the supreme court issued its decision in ''[[dred scott v. sandford]]'';

lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the [[slave power]].&lt;ref&gt;zarefsky, pp. 69–110.&lt;/ref&gt; lincoln argued, &quot;the authors of the declaration of independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;jaffa, pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt;===lincoln–douglas debates and cooper union speech==={{further information|lincoln–douglas debates|cooper union speech}}[[file:abraham lincoln by byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|220px|lincoln in 1858, the year of [[lincoln–douglas debates|his debates]] with [[stephen a. douglas|stephen douglas]] over slavery]]douglas was up for re-election in 1858, and lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful illinois democrat. with the former democrat trumbull now serving as a republican senator, many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858, and lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;white, pp. 247–248&quot;&gt;white, pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

but many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference. for the first time, illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate, and lincoln won the party's senate nomination with little opposition.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 247–250.&lt;/ref&gt;accepting the nomination, lincoln delivered his [[lincoln's house divided speech|house divided speech]], drawing on {{bibleverse|mark|3:25|9}}, &quot;a house divided against itself cannot stand. i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved—i do not expect the house to fall—but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;white, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied republicans across the north.&lt;ref&gt;harris, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would, in turn, select lincoln or douglas as its u.s. senator.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. lincoln warned that &quot;[[the slave power]]&quot; was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that [[all men are created equal]], while douglas emphasized his [[freeport doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 214–224.&lt;/ref&gt; the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. lincoln stated douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the u.s. supreme court and the ''dred scott'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected douglas to the senate. despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.&lt;ref&gt;carwardine (2003), pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; in may 1859, lincoln purchased the ''illinois staats-anzeiger'', a german-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that a german-language paper could mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 242, 412.&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate in 1860, with [[william h. seward]], [[salmon p. chase]], [[edward bates]], and [[simon cameron]] looming as rivals for the nomination. while lincoln was popular in the midwest, he lacked support in the northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 291–293.&lt;/ref&gt; in january 1860, lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed lincoln for president.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 307–308.&lt;/ref&gt;on february 27, 1860, new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a [[cooper union speech|speech at cooper union]] to a group of powerful republicans. lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;jaffa, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

they did just that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;on april 15, lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect washington, and &quot;preserve the union&quot;, which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. this call forced the states to choose sides. virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital, despite the exposed position of [[richmond, virginia|richmond]] so close to union lines. north carolina, tennessee, and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland, but did not prevail;

having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. he signed into law senator charles sumner's [[freedmen's bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction. shortly before his assassination, lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction. discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern unionists.&lt;ref&gt;carwardine (2003), pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. lincoln biographers [[james g. randall]] and [[richard current]], according to david lincove, argue that::it is likely that had he lived, lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnson's mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=lincove|first=david a.|title=reconstruction in the united states: an annotated bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3eqct7-dpi0c&amp;pg=pa80|year= 2000|publisher=greenwood|page=80|access-date=june 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[eric foner]] argues that::unlike sumner and other radicals, lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. he believed, as most republicans did in april 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former confederates. but time and again during the war, lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans.&amp;nbsp;... lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves&amp;nbsp;... it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=foner|first=eric|title=the fiery trial: abraham lincoln and american slavery|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4b8m7cv3wtic&amp;pg=pa335|year=2010|publisher=w. w. norton|pages=334–36|access-date=june 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;===redefining the republic and republicanism===[[file:abraham lincoln o-116 by gardner, 1865-crop.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=an older, tired-looking abraham lincoln with a beard.|lincoln in february 1865, about two months before his death]]the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. the term &quot;the united states&quot;

of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;jaffa, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; the declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early 1860, &quot;lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;diggins, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;foner (2010), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, in 1861, lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.&lt;ref&gt;jaffa, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; burton (2008) argues that lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated.&lt;ref&gt;orville vernon burton, ''the age of lincoln'' (2008) p 243&lt;/ref&gt;in march 1861, in [[lincoln's first inaugural address]], he explored the nature of democracy. he denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system. he said &quot;a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;belz (1998), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}===other enactments===lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency, which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them. lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress;

after willie's death, lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. he wrote at this time that god &quot;could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest. yet the contest began. and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day. yet the contest proceeds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;wilson, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

in presidential ranking polls conducted in the united states since 1948, lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls. generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. lincoln; 2. george washington; and 3. franklin d. roosevelt, although lincoln and washington, and washington and roosevelt, are occasionally reversed.&lt;ref&gt;densen, john v., editor, ''reassessing the presidency, the rise of the executive state and the decline of freedom'' (ludwig von mises institute, 2001), pgs. 1–32;

 historians have said he was &quot;a classical liberal&quot; in the 19th century sense.  [[allen c. guelzo]] states that lincoln was a::classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an american counterpart to mill, cobden, and bright (whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=joseph r. fornieri|author2=sara vaughn gabbard|title=lincoln's america: 1809 –

reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the [[progressive era]] (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in american history, with even white southerners in agreement. the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[lincoln memorial]] on the [[national mall]] in [[washington, d.c.]]&lt;ref&gt;schwartz (2000), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[new deal]] era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. in the [[cold war]] years, lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.&lt;ref&gt;schwartz (2009), pp. 23, 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;by the 1970s lincoln had become a hero to [[conservatism in the united states|political conservatives]]&lt;ref&gt;havers, p. 96. apart from neo-confederates such as [[mel bradford]] who denounced his treatment of the white south.&lt;/ref&gt; for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of [[john locke|lockean]] and [[edmund burke|burkean]] principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers.&lt;ref&gt;belz (2006), pp. 514–518.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;graebner, pp. 67–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;smith, pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt; as a whig activist, lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the [[jacksonian democracy|agrarian democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;boritt (1994), pp. 196, 198, 228, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; william c. harris found that lincoln's &quot;reverence for the founding fathers, the constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;harris, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; james g. randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation &quot;in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform&quot;. randall concludes that, &quot;he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the south, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;randall (1947), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;by the late 1960s, some african american intellectuals led by  [[lerone bennett jr.]], rejected lincoln's role as the great emancipator.&lt;ref&gt;zilversmit, &quot;lincoln and the problem of race: a decade of interpretations&quot; (1980) pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;john m. barr, &quot;holding up a flawed mirror to the american soul: abraham lincoln in the writings of lerone bennett jr.,&quot; ''journal of the abraham lincoln association'' 35 (winter 2014), 43–65&lt;/ref&gt; bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;bennett, pp. 35–42.&lt;/ref&gt; he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed [[american colonization society|sending freed slaves]] to another country. defenders, such as authors dirck and cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;&lt;ref&gt;dirck (2008), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was a &quot;moral visionary&quot; who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.&lt;ref&gt;striner, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; the emphasis shifted away from lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;cashin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;kelley &amp; lewis, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincoln's image suffered &quot;erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule&quot; in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;schwartz (2009), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of [[negative capability]], defined by the poet [[john keats]] and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were &quot;content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 21st century, president [[barack obama]] named lincoln his favorite

still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance (see ''[[aristotle#universals and particulars|universals and particulars]]'', below). in a certain sense, aristotle's method is both [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], while plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =jori | first =alberto | title =aristotele | publisher =bruno mondadori editore | date =2003 | location =milano}}&lt;/ref&gt;in aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. in modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method. in contrast, aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.in the larger sense of the word, aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. for aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''metaphysics'' 1025b25). by practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.&lt;ref name=&quot;sep&quot;/&gt;if logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[logic]]; (2) theoretical philosophy, including metaphysics, physics and mathematics; (3) practical philosophy and (4) poetical philosophy.in the period between his two stays in athens, between his times at the academy and the lyceum, aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. in fact, most of aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. he did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. he had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.his writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. for example, in his ''[[history of animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''history of animals'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; in a similar vein, [[john philoponus]], and later [[galileo galilei|galileo]], showed by simple experiments that aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.&lt;ref name=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 |title=stanford encyclopedia of philosophy |publisher=plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=26 april 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, aristotle refuted [[democritus]]'s claim that the [[milky way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given &quot;current astronomical demonstrations&quot; that &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then&amp;nbsp;... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''meteorology'' 1.8, trans. e.w. webster, rev. j. barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. he posited a [[geocentrism|geocentric cosmology]] that we may discern in selections of the ''metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. from the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational [[history of the center of the universe|center of the universe]].because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance, these thinkers often took aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[[john burnet (classicist)|burnet, john]]. 1928. ''platonism'', berkeley: university of california press, pp. 61, 103–04.&lt;/ref&gt; however, aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. for instance, he founded logic as a [[formal science]] and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.===geology===as quoted from [[w:charles lyell|charles lyell's]] ''[[principles of geology]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;he [aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer, to the shallowing of the [[palus maeotis]] within sixty years from his own time&amp;nbsp;... he alludes&amp;nbsp;... to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. the changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.he says [12th chapter of his ''meteorics''] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.' the concluding observation is as follows: 'as time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the tanais, nor the nile, can have flowed for ever. the places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. so also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.'&lt;ref&gt;[[q:charles lyell|charles lyell]], ''[https://archive.org/details/principlesgeolo01unkngoog principles of geology]'', 1832, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;===physics==={{main article|aristotelian physics}}====five elements===={{main article|classical element}}aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by [[empedocles]].* [[earth (classical element)|earth]], which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid.* [[water (classical element)|water]], which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid.* [[air (classical element)|air]], which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas.* [[fire (classical element)|fire]], which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] and heat.* [[aether (classical element)|aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the [[celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]] and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e., the center of the earth. water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the moon orbits). when elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. this is &quot;natural motion&quot; – motion requiring no extrinsic cause. so, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises. outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.====motion===={{main article|potentiality and actuality}}aristotle defined [[motion (physics)|motion]] as the actuality of a potentiality ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;''physics'' 201a10–11, 201a27–29, 201b4–5&lt;/ref&gt; aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. because [[aristotle#substance, potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]] are normally opposites in aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the &quot;as such&quot; to the definition is critical to understanding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=sachs|first=joe|title=aristotle: motion and its place in nature|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/ |work=internet encyclopedia of philosophy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411034200/http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/ |archivedate=11 april 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;====causality, the four causes==== &lt;!--linked from [[retrocausality]] and [[physics (aristotle)]] (see [[wp:mos#section management]])--&gt;{{main article|four causes}}aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors.  his name ''aitia'' is traditionally translated as &quot;cause&quot;, but it does not always refer to temporal sequence;  it might be better translated as &quot;explanation&quot;, but the traditional rendering will be employed here.* [[material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. it is not about action. it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.* the [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. it tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. a simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.* the [[efficient cause]] is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. it identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. so, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.* the [[final cause]] (''telos'') is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. this covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs.additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) moreover, aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. all causes, both proper and incidental, can be spoken of as actual or potential, and as generic or particular. the same language refers to the effects of causes, so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes, generic effects to generic causes, and particular effects to particular causes.====optics====aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. the second oldest written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] (after [[mozi]] c. 400 bc) can be found in aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350&amp;nbsp;bc in ''problemata''. aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter. aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. in modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]. aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=lahanas |first=michael |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/greeks/optics.htm |title=optics and ancient greeks |publisher=mlahanas.de |accessdate=26 april 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051535/http://www.mlahanas.de/greeks/optics.htm |archivedate=11 april 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;====chance and spontaneity====according to aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. it is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). for a better understanding of aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.for example: a person seeks donations. that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. however, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. it must be unusual that something happens by chance. in other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.there is also more specific kind of chance, which aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions. according to aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;===metaphysics==={{main article|metaphysics (aristotle)}}aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of [[hylomorphism|immaterial]] being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of [[abstraction]].&quot; he refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science&quot;.====substance, potentiality and actuality===={{see also|potentiality and actuality (aristotle)}}aristotle examines the concepts of [[substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]] (''ousia'') in his ''metaphysics'' (book vii), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. in book viii, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. for example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]) that let us define something as a house. the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''metaphysics'' viii 1043a 10–30&lt;/ref&gt;with regard to the change (''[[potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his ''[[physics (aristotle)|physics]]'' and ''[[on generation and corruption]]'' 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;# locomotion, which is change in space; and# alteration, which is change in quality.the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form.referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. for example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. for example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate&amp;nbsp;– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise&amp;nbsp;– acting).actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.&lt;blockquote&gt;for that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. for animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''metaphysics'' ix 1050a 5–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;in summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.with this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? since, according to plato there are two ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? however, according to aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''metaphysics'' viii 1045a–b&lt;/ref&gt;====universals and particulars===={{main article|aristotle's theory of universals}}aristotle's predecessor, plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. when we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. in this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. for example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. [[bertrand russell]] is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;.aristotle disagreed with plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. according to aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. consequently, according to aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.in addition, aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals. as plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. so, according to aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.===biology and medicine==={{main article|aristotle's biology}}in aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. he dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.====empirical research program====[[file:octopus3.jpg|thumb|octopus swimming]][[file:torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''torpedo fuscomaculata'']][[file:triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|leopard shark]]aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. the works that reflect this research, the ''[[history of animals]]'', ''[[generation of animals]]'', ''[[movement of animals]]'', and ''[[parts of animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. the most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. his observations on [[catfish]], [[electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[torpedo (genus)|torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''octopus'', ''sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[argonauta argo]]''). his description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. he separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;singer, charles 1931&quot;&gt;singer, charles.

what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood'. animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs).aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[final cause]]s, guided all natural processes. such a [[teleological]] view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns i have never seen,&quot; aristotle suggested that nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with nature trying to preserve a type of balance.&lt;ref&gt;mason, ''a history of the sciences'' pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;he stated in the ''history of animals'' that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the ''[[great chain of being|scala naturae]]'' or great chain of being.&lt;ref&gt;mayr, ''the growth of biological thought'', pp. 201–02; see also: lovejoy, ''the great chain of being''&lt;/ref&gt; his system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth. the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. for [[charles singer]], &quot;nothing is more remarkable than [aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;singer, charles 1931&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.&lt;/ref&gt;aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.he placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''de anima'' ii 3&lt;/ref&gt;aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;mason, ''a history of the sciences'' pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

it is not until the age of [[alexandria]] under the [[ptolemaic dynasty|ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.the first medical teacher at alexandria, [[herophilos|herophilus of chalcedon]], corrected aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;mason, ''a history of the sciences'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries.

like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. the unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.for aristotle, the soul (''psyche'') was a simpler concept than it is for us today. by soul he simply meant the [[hylomorphism#body–soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which aristotle considers types of movement).&lt;ref&gt;stanford encyclopedia of philosophy, article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ &quot;psychology&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;====memory====according to aristotle, [[memory]] is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal &quot;appearance&quot; and an occurrence in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=bloch |first=david |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qwthng_5rqac&amp;pg=pr9&amp;dq=aristotle+on+memory+and+recollection#v=onepage&amp;q=aristotle%20on%20memory%20and%20recollection&amp;f=false |title=aristotle on memory and recollection |date=2007 |page=12|isbn=90-04-16046-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) in which aristotle defines in ''de anima'', as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory. aristotle believed an &quot;imprint&quot; becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. a memory occurs when a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once. these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of [[sense|sensation]], [[common sense]], and [[thinking]] .{{sfn|bloch|2007|p=61}} the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception. it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard, every experience ends up as a mental image in memory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=carruthers |first=mary |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dntranqfiasc&amp;pg=pr8&amp;dq=the+book+of+memory:+the+study+of+memory+in+medieval+times#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20book%20of%20memory%3a%20the%20study%20of%20memory%20in%20medieval%20times&amp;f=false |title=the book of memory: a study of memory in medieval culture |date=2007 |page=16|isbn=978-0-521-42973-3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;aristotle uses the word &quot;memory&quot; for two basic abilities. first, the actual retaining of the experience in the [[mnemonic]] &quot;imprint&quot; that can develop from sensation. second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the &quot;imprint&quot; due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. therefore, memory is of the past, {{sfn|bloch|2007|p=25}} prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. the retrieval of our &quot;imprints&quot; cannot be performed suddenly. a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the &quot;imprint&quot; can easily continue. however, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new &quot;imprints&quot;. he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an &quot;imprint&quot;. young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new &quot;imprints&quot;. likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have [[perception]] of time.=====recollection=====because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or &quot;imprints&quot;, people are continually weaving together new &quot;imprints&quot;

is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. when people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed.{{sfn|warren|1921|p=25}}recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory &quot;imprint&quot;

of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations. remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. recollection of an &quot;imprint&quot; is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences. when an &quot;imprint&quot; is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related &quot;imprints&quot;.{{sfn|warren|1921|p=296}}aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain &quot;imprints&quot;, was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity. these three laws make up his [[laws of association]]. aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. according to aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn|warren|1921|p=259}}====dreams=========sleep=====before understanding aristotle's views on dreams, first his idea of sleep must be examined. aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in ''on sleep and wakefulness''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aristotle on dreaming: what goes on in sleep when the 'big fire' goes out&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=holowchak|first1=mark|title=aristotle on dreaming: what goes on in sleep when the 'big fire' goes out|journal=ancient philosophy|date=1996|volume=16|issue=2|pages=405–23|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/ancientphil/ancient-philosophy|accessdate=7 november 2014|doi=10.5840/ancientphil199616244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

these ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams, but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;webb&quot;/&gt;aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not. he claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it.&lt;ref name=&quot;modrak&quot;/&gt;

the actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses, the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream.&lt;ref name=&quot;modrak&quot;/&gt; lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.&lt;ref name=&quot;modrak&quot;/&gt;===practical philosophy=======ethics===={{main article|aristotelian ethics}}aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. he wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[nicomachean ethics]]''.aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[de anima|psuchē]]'' (normally translated as ''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or sometimes &quot;well being&quot;. to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]''), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).&lt;ref&gt;[[nicomachean ethics]] book i. see for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0054%3abekker%20page%3d1098a 1098a].&lt;/ref&gt;aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished [[theory|theoretical]] or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;[[nicomachean ethics]] book vi.&lt;/ref&gt;====politics===={{main article|politics (aristotle)}}[[file:aristotle-constitutions-2.png|thumb|240px|aristotle's classification of [[constitution]]s]]in addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[politics (aristotle)|politics]]''. aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, &quot;for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;politics 1253a19–24&lt;/ref&gt;

aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=ebenstein |first=alan |author-link=alan o. ebenstein |author2=william ebenstein |title=introduction to political thinkers |publisher=wadsworth group |date=2002 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotle's understanding. although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political &quot;community&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; (''koinōnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29–31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: &quot;the political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1–3) --&gt;.&quot;

for all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.''====rhetoric and poetics===={{main article|rhetoric (aristotle)|poetics (aristotle)}}aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' i 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; for example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. the forms also differ in their object of imitation. comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' iii&lt;/ref&gt; aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' iv&lt;/ref&gt;while it is believed that aristotle's ''poetics'' comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' vi&lt;/ref&gt; the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. aristotle concludes ''poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[pythia|delphic oracle]] and studied the fables of [[aesop]].&lt;ref&gt;temple, olivia, and temple, robert (translators), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zb-rvxpvtpec&amp;pg=pr3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_0 the complete fables by aesop] penguin classics, 1998. {{isbn|0-14-044649-4}} cf. introduction, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;===views on women==={{main article|aristotle's views on women}}aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. on this ground, [[feminist metaphysics]] have accused aristotle of [[misogyny]]&lt;ref name=&quot;freeland&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=freeland |first=cynthia a. | title=feminist interpretations of aristotle | publisher=penn state university press | date=1998 | isbn=0-271-01730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;morsink&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=morsink |first=johannes | jstor=10.2307/4330727 | title=was aristotle's biology sexist?

the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus, who in turn willed them to [[neleus of scepsis]]. neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to [[scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century bc, when [[apellicon of teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to athens. according to the story, apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. when [[lucius cornelius sulla]] occupied athens in 86 bc, he carried off the library of apellicon to rome, where they were first published in 60 bc by the grammarian [[tyrannion of amisus]] and then by the philosopher [[andronicus of rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;ancient rome: from the early republic to the assassination of julius caesar – p. 513, matthew dillon, lynda garland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;the encyclopedia americana, volume 22 – p. 131, grolier incorporated – juvenile nonfiction&lt;/ref&gt;carnes lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides &quot;the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing aristotelianism during the first century b.c.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=lord |first=carnes |title=introduction to the politics, by aristotle |publisher=[[chicago university press]] |date=1984 |location=chicago |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. first, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair.second, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis. third, the definitive edition of aristotle's texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his. and fourth, ancient library catalogues predating andronicus' intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. lord sees a number of post-aristotelian interpolations in the ''[[politics (aristotle)|politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.on the one hand, the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within aristotle's school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the [[corpus aristotelicum#fragments|dialogues and other &quot;exoteric&quot; texts]] which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime. the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.&lt;ref&gt;anagnostopoulos, g., &quot;aristotle's works and thoughts&quot;, ''a companion to aristotle'' (blackwell publishing, 2009), p. 16.  see also, {{harvnb|barnes|1995|pp=10–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;==legacy==[[file:aristotle by jusepe de ribera.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;aristotle&quot;

[[bertrand russell]] notes that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine&quot;. russell also refers to aristotle's ethics as &quot;repulsive&quot;, and calls his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy&quot;. russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt;===later greek philosophers===the immediate influence of aristotle's work was felt as the lyceum grew into the [[peripatetic school]]. aristotle's notable students included [[aristoxenus]], [[dicaearchus]], [[demetrius of phalerum]], [[eudemos of rhodes]], [[harpalus]], [[hephaestion]], [[mnason of phocis]], [[nicomachus (son of aristotle)|nicomachus]], and [[theophrastus]]. aristotle's influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher. although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, alexander complained &quot;thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;plutarch, ''life of alexander''&lt;/ref&gt;===influence on byzantine scholars===greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus. the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were [[john philoponus]], elias, and david in the sixth century, and [[stephen of alexandria]] in the early seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;richard sorabji, ed. ''aristotle transformed'' london, 1990, pp. 20, 28, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[john philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of aristotelian thought.&lt;ref&gt;richard sorabji, ed. ''aristotle transformed'' (london, 1990) pp. 233–74.&lt;/ref&gt; after a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by eustratius and [[michael of ephesus]] reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[anna comnena]].&lt;ref&gt;richard sorabji, ed. ''aristotle transformed'' (london, 1990) pp. 20–21; 28–29, 393–406; 407–08.&lt;/ref&gt;===influence on islamic theologians===aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early [[islamic theology]]. most of the still extant works of aristotle,&lt;ref name=&quot;referencea&quot;&gt;''encyclopedia of islam'', ''aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of the original greek commentaries, were translated into arabic and studied by [[muslim]] philosophers, scientists and scholars. [[averroes]], [[avicenna]] and [[alpharabius]], who wrote on aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[thomas aquinas]] and other western christian scholastic philosophers. [[alkindus]] considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy&lt;ref&gt;''rasa'il'' i, 103, 17, abu rida&lt;/ref&gt; and averroes spoke of aristotle as the &quot;exemplar&quot; for all future philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;''comm. magnum'' in aristotle'', ''de anima'', iii, 2, 43 crawford&lt;/ref&gt; medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the &quot;first teacher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''al-mua'llim al-thani'', ''aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; the title &quot;teacher&quot; was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars, and was later used by western philosophers (as in the famous poem of [[dante alighieri|dante]]) who were influenced by the tradition of [[islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=nasr |first=seyyed hossein |title=the islamic intellectual tradition in persia |date=1996 |publisher=curzon press|isbn=0-7007-0314-4 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;in accordance with the [[greeks|greek]] theorists, the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that aristotle shared with [[plato]] essential tenets of thought. some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo-platonic metaphysical ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;referencea&quot;/&gt;===influence on western christian theologians===with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west, aristotle was practically unknown there from c. ad 600 to c. 1100 except through the latin translation of the ''organon'' made by [[boethius]]. in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made, both from arabic translations, such as those by [[gerard of cremona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sep |url-id=arabic-islamic-influence |title=influence of arabic and islamic philosophy on the latin west}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the original greek, such as those by [[james of venice]] and [[william of moerbeke]].after [[thomas aquinas]] wrote his theology, working from moerbeke's translations, the demand for aristotle's writings grew and the [[greek language|greek]] manuscripts returned to the west, stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the [[renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sep |url-id=aristotelianism-renaissance |title=aristotelianism in the renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt; aristotle is referred to as &quot;the philosopher&quot; by [[scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers such as [[thomas aquinas]] (see ''[[summa theologica]]'', part i, question 3, etc.). these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity, bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages. it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. the medieval english poet [[geoffrey chaucer|chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;at his beddes heedtwenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,of aristotle and his philosophie,&lt;ref&gt;geoffrey chaucer, ''[[the canterbury tales]]'', prologue, lines 295–295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;the italian poet [[dante alighieri|dante]] says of aristotle in [[the divine comedy|the first circles of hell]],&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;vidi 'l maestro di color che sannoseder tra filosofica famiglia.tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno:quivi vid'ïo socrate e platoneche 'nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;i saw the master there of those who know,amid the philosophic family,by all admired, and by all reverenced;there plato too i saw, and socrates,who stood beside him closer than the rest.:—dante, ''l'inferno'' (hell), canto iv. lines 131–135&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;===post-enlightenment thinkers===the german philosopher [[friedrich nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; however debatable this is, aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people (&quot;natural [[slavery|slaves]]&quot;), and the natural superiority (virtue, ''arete'') of others. it is [[martin heidegger]], not nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. [[ayn rand]] accredited aristotle as &quot;the greatest philosopher in history&quot; and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. more recently, [[alasdair macintyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans.&lt;ref&gt;kelvin knight, ''aristotelian philosophy'', polity press, 2007, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;==list of works=={{main article|corpus aristotelicum}}the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum. these texts, as opposed to aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle's school. reference to them is made according to the organization of [[immanuel bekker]]'s royal prussian academy edition (''aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica'', berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.==eponyms==[[file:aristotle - jefferson building - library of congress.jpg|thumb|250px|&quot;aristotle&quot; near the ceiling of the great hall in the [[library of congress]]]]the [[aristotle mountains]] along the [[oscar ii coast]] of [[graham land]], [[antarctica]], are named after aristotle. he was the first person known to conjecture, in his book ''[[meteorology (aristotle)|meteorology]]'', the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and call it &quot;antarctica&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137410 aristotle mountains.] [[scar]] [[composite antarctic gazetteer]].&lt;/ref&gt;[[aristoteles (crater)|aristoteles]] is a crater on the moon bearing the classical form of aristotle's name.==see also==* [[aristotelian physics]]* [[aristotelian society]]* [[aristotelian theology]]* [[conimbricenses]]* [[list of writers influenced by aristotle]]* [[otium]]* [[philia]]* [[pseudo-aristotle]]==notes and references=={{reflist}}==further reading==the secondary literature on aristotle is vast. the following references are only a small selection.{{refbegin|30em}}* [[j. l. ackrill|ackrill j. l.]] (1997).

paris''''' is a [[jazz]]-influenced orchestral piece by the american composer [[george gershwin]], written in 1928. inspired by the time gershwin had spent in [[paris]], it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the 1920s and is one of his best-known compositions.gershwin composed ''an american in paris'' on commission from the conductor [[walter damrosch]]. he scored the piece for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], [[saxophone]]s, and automobile horns. he brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition, which took place on december&amp;nbsp;13, 1928, in [[carnegie hall]], with damrosch conducting the [[new york philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

richard freed | accessdate = 5 december 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[deems taylor]], noting that: &quot;my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere.&quot; when the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], &quot;our american friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of [[homesickness]].&quot; but, &quot;nostalgia is not a fatal disease.&quot; the american visitor &quot;once again is an alert spectator of parisian life&quot; and &quot;the street noises and french atmosphere are triumphant.&quot;==background==gershwin was attracted by [[maurice ravel]]'s unusual chords.  after transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether ravel took students and how much he charged, ravel looked at gershwin's prior year earnings and sent a telegram to gershwin jokingly saying he (ravel) should study with gershwin. but ravel accepted him as a student, and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in 1926 ready to study. after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, ravel said he couldn't teach him but he would send a letter referring him to [[nadia boulanger]]. while the studies were cut short, that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as a 'thank you note' to  gershwin's hosts, robert and mabel shirmer. gershwin called it &quot;a rhapsodic ballet&quot;; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works.gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour, something ravel had been reluctant to do.  to this end, upon his return to new york, gershwin joined the efforts of ravel's friend [[e. robert schmitz|robert schmitz]], a pianist ravel had met during the war, to urge ravel to tour the u.s. schmitz was the head of pro musica, promoting franco-american musical relations, and was able to offer ravel a $12,000 fee for the tour, an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel.    gershwin greeted ravel in new york in february 1928 at the start of ravel's u.s. tour, and joined  ravel again later in the tour in los angeles.  after a lunch together with [[charlie chaplin|chaplin]] in beverly hills, ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled 'house concert' in a friend's music salon, performing among kindred spirits.ravel's tour reignited gershwin's desire to return to paris which he did in march 1928. ravel's high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris.  yet after playing for her, she told him she could not teach him. nadia boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students &quot;don't copy others; be yourself.&quot; in this case &quot;why try to be a second rate ravel when you are already a first rate gershwin?&quot;  this did not set gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his ''[[rhapsody in blue]]''. paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them [[ezra pound]], [[w. b. yeats]], [[ernest hemingway]]; and artist [[pablo picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;lsri archives oral interview anita loos and mary anita loos october 1979 re: letters and ravel's telegram to gershwin&lt;/ref&gt;==composition==gershwin based ''an american in paris'' on a melodic fragment called &quot;very parisienne&quot;, written in 1926 on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts, robert and mabel schirmer. he described the piece as a &quot;rhapsodic ballet&quot; because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. gershwin explained in ''[[musical america]]'', &quot;my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the french atmosphere.&quot;the piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[ternary form|aba format]]. gershwin's first a episode introduces the two main &quot;walking&quot; themes in the &quot;allegretto grazioso&quot; and develops a third theme in the &quot;subito con brio&quot;. the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers [[claude debussy]] and [[les six]]. this a section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, english horn, and taxi horns. the b section's &quot;andante ma con ritmo deciso&quot; introduces the american [[blues]] and spasms of homesickness. the &quot;allegro&quot; that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. in the b section, gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. &quot;moderato con grazia&quot; is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a. after recapitulating the &quot;walking&quot; themes, gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final “grandioso.”==instrumentation==''an american in paris'' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[english horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|b-flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in b-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[french horn|horn]]s in f, 3 [[trumpet]]s in b-flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[wood block]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as a, b, c and d with circles around them, [[alto saxophone]]/[[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, [[baritone

in labeling the taxi horns as a, b, c and d with circles, he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played.the revised edition by f. campbell-watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. in this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments. in 2000 gershwin specialist [[jack gibbons]] made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris, working directly from gershwin's original manuscript, including the restoration of gershwin's soprano saxophone parts removed in f. campbell-watson's revision; gibbons' restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at london's queen elizabeth hall on july 9, 2000 by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jackgibbons.com/reviews.htm|title=musical opinion review of gershwin spectacular|accessdate=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[william merrigan daly|william daly]] arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in 1929.==response==gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''an american in paris''. he stated that damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. the audience, according to edward cushing, responded with &quot;a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.&quot; critics believed that ''an american in paris'' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[concerto in f (gershwin)|concerto in f]]. some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[césar franck]], [[richard wagner]], or [[guillaume lekeu]] on its premiere. gershwin responded to the critics, &quot;it's not a beethoven symphony, you know... it's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. it's not intended to draw tears. if it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.&quot;==preservation status==on september 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. the gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[library of congress]] and the [[university of michigan]], are working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin's true intent. it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during gershwin's composition process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/ |title=new, critical edition

victor]] in 1929 with [[nathaniel shilkret]] conducting the [[rca victor symphony orchestra]], drawn from members of the [[philadelphia orchestra]]. gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. then, a little later, shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo; gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a flat, b flat, a higher c and a lower d.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;  the radio broadcast of the september&amp;nbsp;8, 1937 hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert, in which ''an american in paris,'' also conducted by shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-cd set. [[arthur fiedler]] and the [[boston pops orchestra]] recorded the work for rca victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. in 1945, [[arturo toscanini]] conducting  the [[nbc symphony orchestra]] recorded the piece for [[rca victor]], one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer. the [[seattle symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=bargreen |first=melinda |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900628&amp;slug=1079541 |title=entertainment &amp; the arts &amp;#124; recordings &amp;#124; seattle times newspaper |website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=1990-06-28 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[harry james]] released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album ''one night stand,'' recorded live at the [[aragon ballroom (chicago)|aragon ballroom in chicago]] ([[columbia records|columbia]] gl 522 and cl 522). conductor steven richman and harmonie ensemble, new york released a recording of gershwin's original orchestrations in 2016 on harmonia mundi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harmonieensembleny.com/ new cd release: gershwin cd: american in paris, concerto in f, three preludes (arr. roy bargy), overture to &quot;of thee i sing&quot; (1934 radio version). released august 26, 2016. harmonie ensemble/new york; steven richman, conductor, at harmonieensembleny.com] accessed 2017-06-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://piasclassicsusa.com/harmonieensemblenewyork/ steven richman, harmonie ensemble/new york; george gershwin cd: american in paris, concerto in f, etc. release date: august 26, 2016 at piasclassicsusa.com]  accessed 2017-06-20&lt;/ref&gt;==use in film==in 1951, [[metro-goldwyn-mayer]] released the musical film ''[[an american in paris (film)|an american in paris]]'', featuring [[gene kelly]] and [[leslie caron]]. winning the 1951 best picture oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by [[vincente minnelli]], featured many tunes of gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the ''an american in paris'' symphonic poem (arranged for the film by [[johnny green]]), costing $500,000.==references=={{reflist}}==further reading==* rimler, walter.

early march following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. it is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during november or december of the previous year. this is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)the academy awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all united states time zones (excluding hawaii; they aired live in [[alaska]] starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), canada, the united kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.the oscars were first televised in 1953 by [[nbc]], which continued to broadcast the event until 1960, when [[american broadcasting company|abc]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970, after which nbc resumed the broadcasts. abc once again took over broadcast duties in 1976, and has broadcast the oscars ever since; its current contract with the academy runs through 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url

timeslots. the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two south american countries, chile and brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. by that time, the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in 50 countries. a decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the tv rights to the awards were licensed in 76 countries.the ceremonies were moved up from late march or early april to late february or early march starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[for your consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[oscar season]] in the film industry. another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success of the [[ncaa division i men's basketball tournament]], which would cut into the academy awards audience. the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february [[sweeps]] period. some years, the ceremony is moved into early march in deference to the [[winter olympic games|winter olympics]]. another reason for the move to late february and early march is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[passover]] and [[easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. the awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[emmy awards|emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =

discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead.in terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. the first oscars, in 1929,

 this combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ circular t], and is the [[canonical form|canonical]] tai.  this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc-utc(''k'') (equivalent to tai-tai(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  (the same circular also gives tables of tai-ta(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.)errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t.  aside from this, once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised.  in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  doing so does not create another version of tai; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[terrestrial time]] (tt).==history==early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the [[national physical laboratory (united kingdom)|national physical laboratory, uk (npl)]]. the &quot;greenwich atomic&quot; (ga) scale began in 1955 at the [[royal greenwich observatory]]. the [[international time bureau]] (bih) began a time scale, t&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; or am, in july 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[vlf]] radio signals. the [[united states naval observatory]] began the a.1 scale  13 september 1956, using an atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the nbs-a scale at the national bureau of standards, [[boulder, colorado]].   both the bih scale and a.1 were defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read julian date 2436204.5 (1 january 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[ut2]] instant. the procedures used by the bih evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: &quot;a3&quot; in 1963 and &quot;ta(bih)&quot; in 1969.&lt;ref name=mccarthy2009/&gt;{{rp|199&amp;ndash;201}}  this synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of ut2.  at the time, ut2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 the name international atomic time (tai) was assigned to a time scale based on si seconds with no leap seconds.&lt;ref name=mccarthy2009/&gt;{{rp|202&amp;ndash;4}} during this time, irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected. in 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates, but this was disproven in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;william markowitz. &quot;nondependence of frequency on mass: a differential experiment&quot; {{doi|10.1126/science.162.3860.1387}}&lt;/ref&gt;in the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  starting from julian date 2443144.5 (1 january 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that tai would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that tai slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.  the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''eal'' (''echelle atomique libre'', meaning ''free atomic scale'').&lt;ref name=mccarthy2009/&gt;{{rp|215}}the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[barycentric coordinate time]] (tcb), [[geocentric coordinate time]] (tcg), and [[terrestrial time]] (tt), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;brumberg v.a. &amp; kopeikin s.m., &quot;relativistic time scales in the solar system&quot;, cel. mech. dyn. astron., vol. 48, pp. 23 - 44, 1990 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990cemda..48...23b&lt;/ref&gt;  all three of these time scales were defined to read jd 2443144.5003725 (1 january 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.

includes the individual, love and compassion in buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other. it is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering. in practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as &quot;altruistic.&quot; many would agree with the [[dalai lama]] that buddhism, as a religion, is kindness toward others.{{weasel inline|date=april 2016}}still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: &quot;the more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes&quot; (dalai lama&lt;ref name=&quot;speech by the dalai lama&quot;/&gt;).in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.{{main|karma in buddhism}}in buddhism, ''karma'' (pāli ''kamma'') is strictly distinguished from '''''[[vipaka|vipāka]]''''', meaning &quot;fruit&quot; or &quot;result&quot;. karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (pāli ''hetu'') in the [[twelve nidanas|chain]] of [[pratitya-samutpada|cause and effect]], where it comprises the elements of &quot;volitional activities&quot; (pali ''sankhara'') and &quot;action&quot; (pali ''bhava''). any action is understood to create &quot;seeds&quot; in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (pāli ''vipaka'') when they meet the right conditions. most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of [[samsara (buddhism)|samsāra]]; others will liberate one to [[nirvana|nirvāna]].buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. motivation usually makes the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be &quot;bad&quot; in that it creates unpleasant results for the &quot;actor.&quot;in buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens. as taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as niyama dhammas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = davids| first = rhys| title = buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=lljcz_lbel0c&amp;pg=pa119| year = 2007| publisher = lightning source incorporated| isbn = 978-1-4067-5628-9| page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = padmasiri de silva| title = environmental philosophy and ethics in buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=m4t3c6ndfzic&amp;pg=pa41| year = 1998| publisher = palgrave macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-21316-9| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;* kamma niyama — consequences of one's actions* utu niyama — seasonal changes and climate* biija niyama — laws of heredity* citta niyama — will of mind* dhamma niyama — nature's tendency to produce a perfect type===jainism==={{see also|ahimsa in jainism}}[[file:ahinsa.jpg|thumb|sculpture depicting the jain concept of ''ahimsa'' (non-injury)]]the fundamental principles of [[jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. jainism preaches the view of ''[[ahimsa]]'' – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. it also considers all living things to be equal. the first [[tirthankara]], [[rishabhdev]] introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. one's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. they are:# non-violence (ahimsa);# truthfulness (satya);# non-stealing (asteya);# celibacy (brahmacharya);# [[non-possession]] or non-materialism (aparigraha);the &quot;great vows&quot; ([[mahavrata]]) are prescribed for monks and &quot;limited vows&quot; ([[anuvrata]]) are prescribed for householders. the house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. the monks have to observe them very strictly. with consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.the principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. jainism views every [[soul (jainism)|soul]] as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become ''siddha'' ([[god in jainism]]). because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. this policy extends even to microscopic organisms. jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.===christianity===[[file:stthomasmount theresa.jpg|thumb|statue of [[mother teresa]] in india]]altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the [[gospel]], especially in the [[sermon on the mount]] and the [[sermon on the plain]]. from biblical to medieval [[christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love&quot;, as in the [[paul the apostle|pauline]] phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests.&quot; in his book ''indoctrination and self-deception,'' roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. as in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.[[st thomas aquinas]] interprets 'you should love your neighbour as yourself'&lt;ref&gt;[[leviticus]] 19 and matthew 22&lt;/ref&gt;

and quotes aristotle that &quot;the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[nichomachean ethics]] ix.4 1166a1&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. however, he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. in coining the word altruism, as stated above, [[auguste comte|comte]] was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within catholicism.many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god. 1 john 4 states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of god. [[thomas jay oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. an altruistic action is not always a loving action. oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.german philosopher [[max scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. one way is a sincere expression of christian love, &quot;motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=scheler|first=max|title=ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; another way is merely &quot;one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=scheler|first=max|title=ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its worst, scheler says, &quot;love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=scheler|first=max|title=ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;===islam===in [[islam]], the concept 'īthār' (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. for sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by allah on the human body, considered to be property of allah alone. the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[islam]] considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = m| title = key concepts in the practice of sufism: emerald hills of the heart| year = 2004| publisher = fountain| location = rutherford, n.j.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;this is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that european concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. a constant concern for [[allah]] (i.e. god) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name=&quot;neusner2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = neusner| first = jacob eds| title = altruism in world religions| year = 2005| publisher = georgetown univ. press| location = washington, d.c.| isbn = 1-58901-065-5| pages = 79–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;this concept was emphasized by sufis of islam like [[rabia al-adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to [[allah]] (i.e. god) and dedication to people. thirteenth-century turkish sufi poet [[yunus emre]] explained this philosophy as &quot;yaratılanı severiz, yaratandan ötürü&quot; or ''we love the creature, because of the creator.'' for many muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific islamic holidays. however, i'thar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times.===judaism===judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. the famous rabbi [[abraham isaac kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=ben zion bokser |last1=kook |first1=abraham isaac| title = abraham isaac kook: the lights of penitence, the moral principles, lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems| year = 1978| publisher = paulist press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is defined as [[tzedakah|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god. [[kabbalah]] defines god as the force of giving in [[existence]]. rabbi [[moshe chaim luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = luzzatto| first = moshe Ḥayyim| title = the way of god| year = 1997| publisher = feldheim publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;modern kabbalah developed by rabbi [[yehuda ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = ashlag| first = yehuda| title = building the future society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = laitman kabbalah publishers| location = thornhill, canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 120–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = ashlag| first = yehuda| title = building the future society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = laitman kabbalah publishers| location = thornhill, canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 175–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;===sikhism===altruism is essential to the sikh religion. the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness.the fifth nanak, guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the guru granth.  the ninth guru, guru tegh bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. in the late seventeenth century, [[guru gobind singh]] ji (the tenth [[guru]] in sikhism), was in war with the [[mughal empire|mughal]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh, [[bhai kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield.&quot;what were you doing, and why?&quot; asked the guru. &quot;i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them,&quot; replied bhai kanhaiya.the guru responded, &quot;then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru.&quot;it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = o. p. ralhan| title = the great gurus of the sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = anmol publications pvt ltd.| location = new delhi| isbn = 81-7488-479-3| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;===hinduism===[[swami sivananda]], an [[advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the [[brahma sutras]], a vedantic text. in his commentary on chapter 3 of the brahma sutras, sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[merit (buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.however the very well known and popular text, the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga (selfless action) or action without desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality.&lt;ref&gt;sivananda, swami. ''phaladhikaranam, topic 8'', sutras 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;==philosophy=={{main|altruism (ethics)}}there exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. proponents of [[altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. the opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.a related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).==genetics==the genes [[oxtr]], [[cd38]],
